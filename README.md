Bite Size DND is a lite version of DND intended to be played in small, 10 minute increments, such as over lunch.

This app allows you to quickly create and manage your characters.

**Running locally**

This repo only holds the back-end of the application, you'll need the front-end [here](https://github.com/nwdunlap17/minidnd-frontend).

Run the back-end using 'bundle install' followed by 'rails s'. 

By default, the front-end will access the public back-end on heroku, so follow the instructions on the front-end readme to set up locally.
